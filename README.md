#### I'm a graduate student in Bioethics at [NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/centerforbioethics/) researching rationality, decision making, neuroethics, and ethics of emerging technologies.

Before that, I studied Biotechnology at [Columbia](https://www.gsas.columbia.edu/content/biotechnology), and [Philosophy](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/programs/philosophy/ba/) and [Biology](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/programs/biology/ba-cell-molecular-genetics/) at Boston University.
